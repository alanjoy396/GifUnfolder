# GifUnfolder
A program that takes a gif and "unfolds" it, outputting all the frames in the gif into the folder as pngs.

This was built in [Visual Studio 2019]{https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/}, so you'll need it to build a release version of the program. 
You'll also need [ImageMagick]{https://imagemagick.org/index.php} to run the program once you build it. 

Once you do all that, you'll need to put a gif into the same folder as the exe in the release build you make, and then drag that gif onto the GifUnfolder.exe file. You should get all the frames of the gif in that folder as pngs.
